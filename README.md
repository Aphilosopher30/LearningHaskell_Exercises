# Description
Haskell exercises corresponding to the youtube video series [Learning Haskell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn1IOxVplKQ&list=PLHRF-X-NtQR4MZBvm05NshPIEI8ELID5m)

# Instructions
* It's recommended to install Haskell with VS Code as seen in the [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn1IOxVplKQ&list=PLHRF-X-NtQR4MZBvm05NshPIEI8ELID5m&index=1)
* Each project folder (i.e. [HaskellExercises01](file://HaskellExercises01),[HaskellExercises02](file://HaskellExercises02),etc) contains a template file (i.e. [Exercises01.hs](file://HaskellExercises01/src/Exercises01.hs))
  to be completed
* Replace each function with an `error "TODO: ..."` with an actual implementation
* Run `stack test` from the project root to run testing scripts and check your answers
